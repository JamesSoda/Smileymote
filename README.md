Here is some information about Spigot (taken from their Wiki):

  SpigotMC.org is home to the community behind the biggest Minecraft server software projects.
  
  Spigot is both a modified Minecraft server and API. The Spigot server adds many improvements to Minecraft's "vanilla" server. The API allows developers to create plugins which 
  add features to the server never before possible with the vanilla server.
  
  The Spigot Server and API use Java.
